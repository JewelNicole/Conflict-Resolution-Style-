            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> This assessment is designed to help you understand your typical approach to conflict situations. Consider situations where your wishes differ from those of another person.</p>
            <p>For each of the 30 pairs of statements below, select either "A" or "B" to indicate the statement that is <strong>most characteristic</strong> of your own behavior in a conflict.</p>
            <p>In many cases, neither the "A" nor the "B" statement may be perfectly typical of your behavior, but please select the response which you would be <strong>more likely to use</strong>. Answer based on how you <i>actually</i> tend to behave in conflicts, not how you think you <i>should</i> behave.</p>
            <p>There are no right or wrong answers. Your honest responses will provide valuable insights for our upcoming conflict resolution training.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-600">Your highest score indicates your most frequently used conflict style(s). Lower scores indicate styles you use less often. Most people use a mix of styles, but tend to rely on one or two more heavily, depending on the situation. Understanding your dominant style(s) and the situations where each style is most effective is key to improving your conflict resolution skills.</p>

            Competing: {
                title: "1. Competing (Assertive, Uncooperative)",
                goal: "To win. You pursue your own concerns at the other person's expense, using whatever power seems appropriate.",
                behavior: "Standing your ground, debating, asserting, using rank or influence.",
                useful: "Quick, decisive action is vital (e.g., emergencies); on important issues where unpopular actions need implementing (e.g., cost-cutting, enforcing unpopular rules); against people who take advantage of non-competitive behavior.",
                overuse: "Lack of feedback, reduced learning, resentment from others, damaged relationships, others feeling shut down or unheard."
            },
            Collaborating: {
                title: "2. Collaborating (Assertive, Cooperative)",
                goal: "To find a true win-win solution. Involves digging into an issue to identify the underlying concerns of both individuals and find an alternative that meets both sets of concerns.",
                behavior: "Open dialogue, active listening, analyzing differences, exploring creative solutions together.",
                useful: "Concerns of both parties are too important to be compromised; the objective is to learn and understand different perspectives; need to merge insights; need to gain commitment by incorporating everyone's concerns into a consensus; working through feelings that have interfered with a relationship.",
                overuse: "Spending excessive time and energy on minor issues; potential for manipulation if one party isn't genuinely collaborating; feeling overwhelmed by the process if used for all conflicts."
            },
            Compromising: {
                title: "3. Compromising (Intermediate Assertiveness & Cooperativeness)",
                goal: "To find an expedient, mutually acceptable solution that partially satisfies both parties (a quick middle ground). It addresses the issue more directly than avoiding but doesn't explore it in as much depth as collaborating.",
                behavior: "Splitting the difference, exchanging concessions, seeking a quick, fair agreement.",
                useful: "Goals are moderately important but not worth the effort or potential disruption of more assertive modes; opponents with equal power are committed to mutually exclusive goals; to achieve temporary settlements to complex issues; to arrive at expedient solutions under time pressure; as a backup when collaboration or competition is unsuccessful.",
                overuse: "Focusing on negotiation tactics over underlying needs and interests; potentially sub-optimal or unsatisfying solutions for everyone; cynicism if 'split the difference' becomes the default without exploring better options."
            },
            Avoiding: {
                title: "4. Avoiding (Unassertive, Uncooperative)",
                goal: "To delay or sidestep the conflict. You do not immediately pursue your own concerns or those of the other person; you do not address the conflict.",
                behavior: "Sidestepping an issue, postponing discussion, withdrawing from a threatening situation, diplomatically dodging.",
                useful: "An issue is trivial or other issues are more pressing; you perceive no chance of satisfying your concerns; the potential damage of confronting outweighs the benefits of resolution; to let people cool down and regain perspective; gathering more information is needed; others can resolve the conflict more effectively.",
                overuse: "Decisions made by default; unresolved issues festering and potentially worsening; lack of your input on important matters; an environment of uncertainty and tension; others may perceive you as unengaged or uncaring."
            },
            Accommodating: {
                title: "5. Accommodating (Unassertive, Cooperative)",
                goal: "To yield. You neglect your own concerns to satisfy the concerns of the other person; there is an element of self-sacrifice.",
                behavior: "Selflessness, generosity, obeying another person's order when you would prefer not to, yielding to another's point of view.",
                useful: "You realize you are wrong; to allow a better position to be heard; to learn from others; when the issue is much more important to the other person than to you (maintaining the relationship is key); to build social credits for later issues; when harmony and stability are especially important; to allow others to develop by learning from mistakes.",
                overuse: "Neglecting your own needs and concerns; feeling resentful, unheard, or taken advantage of; loss of influence or contribution; others may lose respect if you yield too readily."
